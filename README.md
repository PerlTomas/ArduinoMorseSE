# ArduinoMorseSE
Arduino library for generating morse code on a piezo speaker

I use it for Arduino projects as a alternative to using displays. In some cases you just want to know the status of a device. It's also useful for outdoor projects that has to be weatherproof. You can just place the speaker inside the box and still hear it.
